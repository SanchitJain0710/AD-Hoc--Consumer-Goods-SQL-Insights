🧠 Consumer Goods – Ad-Hoc SQL Insights
SQL project created as part of Codebasics Resume Project Challenge #4 to simulate real-world business problem-solving through SQL. The project represents a set of data requests from AtliQ Hardware — a leading hardware manufacturer — to analyze their product, channel, and sales performance.

🎯 Project Objective
Address 10 real-world ad-hoc data requests from the Director of Analytics at AtliQ Hardware, with the goal to:

•	Extract actionable insights from sales, product, and discount datasets.
•	Apply core SQL techniques to solve business problems.
•	Provide recommendations based on analytical findings.

📊 Key Business Insights
1.	334 unique products launched in 2021 (vs. 245 in 2020)
2.	‘Notebook’ category led with 129 new launches
3.	‘Accessories’ segment showed high YoY growth potential
4.	Flipkart offered steepest average discounts (30.83%) — driving sales via pricing strategy
